## The Challenge
...


## Devices
Use your device of choice! We want you to innovate ideas the way _you_ would like to use your voice to interact with banking services. Choose the device that meets best the requirements of your ideas. Nevertheless, we will provide you with an [Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa) or a [Google Home](http://home.google.com/) device if you're deciding to integrate it into your project.


## APIs
Get a free Azure voucher at our booth to access [Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/). In fact, with that voucher you can access _all_ Azure Services for free.
