# RCH_Hackathon
[Raiffeisen RAIlab](https://www.raiffeisen.ch/winkeln/de/ueber-uns/organisation/rai-lab.html) participates the [HackZurich 2017]() as Gold Sponsor. Here on GitHub hacking teams will find all information they need to join the competition to our challenge.



## The Challenge: Hack a Mind-Blowing Vision of «Voice Banking»
The Raiffeisen Group is the third-largest banking group in Switzerland and leader in retail banking. After 20 years of Online Banking and after 10 years of Mobile Banking we belive it’s time for a new age of Banking. If we look at upcoming trends, we believe that «Voice Banking» might be the future!

By today at least [20% of Google's mobile queries are voice searches](http://searchengineland.com/google-reveals-20-percent-queries-voice-queries-249917). Think about that! What will we be facing ten years from now?

If people are using voice as their favorite interface to talk to their bank, they probably need different services than today. They will be talking to a mobile device or maybe to their intelligent speaker in their living room. So there might not even be a screen available to present the results to their voice query. So start thinking outside the box!

Who will be using voice commands? Where? When? What Services could they be using? Do we already have the technology to fulfill the demands of our future bank customers? Or do we have to reinvent the wheel?

Give us a sneek peek into your offbeat imagination! We are keen to see a prototype of _your_ mind-blowing vision of «Voice Banking»!



## The Reward
The Raiffeisen RAI Lab jury will elect the best prototype of «Voice Banking». The winning team will be rewarded with gold coins worth X thousand Swiss Francs.




## Infrastructure
If you want, use the APIs and devices of your choice. Or even invent everything from scratch: pretend Data-APIs existed by mocking them, generate test data as you need, or use generic data you find on the internet.

Otherwise take benefit of the infrastructure we offer you:

### Devices
Use your device of choice! We want you to innovate ideas the way _you_ would like to use your voice to interact with banking services. Choose the device that meets best the requirements of your ideas. Nevertheless, we will provide you with an [Amazon Echo](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa) or a [Google Home](http://home.google.com/) device if you're deciding to integrate it into your project.



### APIs
If you want you can benefit from existing APIs from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Raiffeisen:

- See how to extend **Google Home** by using [API.AI](https://api.ai/): [How To Build Your Own Action For Google Home Using API.AI](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/05/build-action-google-home-api-ai/).

- See how to extend **Amazon Echo**'s capabilities by using the [Alexa Skills Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit): [Just the Facts, Alexa](https://medium.com/hello-thirteen23/just-the-facts-alexa-71a04b836d7f).

- Get a free **Microsoft Azure** voucher at the Raiffeisen RAI Lab show stand to use Microsoft Azure. Identify the speaker, analyze his state of emotion, turn spoken language into text, make sense ouf of text and understand the user's intent with [Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/). In fact, with that voucher you can access _all_ stunning Azure Services for free!

- Call existing **Raiffeisen** APIs to get anonymized and [categorized financial user transactions](https://github.com/riticulus/RCH_Hackathon/tree/master/apis/transactions) and integrate [financial user budget risk calculations](https://github.com/riticulus/RCH_Hackathon/tree/master/apis/advisoryservice) into your application.
