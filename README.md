# RCH_Hackathon
[Raiffeisen RAIlab](https://www.raiffeisen.ch/winkeln/de/ueber-uns/organisation/rai-lab.html) participates the [HackZurich 2017]() as Gold Sponsor. Here on GitHub hacking teams will find all information they need to join the competition to our challenge.


## The Challenge
...


## Infrastructure
If you want, use the APIs and devices you like. Or even invent everything from scratch: pretend Data-APIs existed by mocking them, generate test data as you need, or use generic data you find on the internet.

Otherwise take benefit of the infrastructure we offer you:

### Devices
Use your device of choice! We want you to innovate ideas the way _you_ would like to use your voice to interact with banking services. Choose the device that meets best the requirements of your ideas. Nevertheless, we will provide you with an [Amazon Echo](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa) or a [Google Home](http://home.google.com/) device if you're deciding to integrate it into your project.



### APIs
If you want you can benefit from existing APIs from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Raiffeisen:

- See how to extend **Google Home** by using [API.AI](https://api.ai/): [How To Build Your Own Action For Google Home Using API.AI](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/05/build-action-google-home-api-ai/).

- See how to extend **Amazon Echo**'s capabilities by using the [Alexa Skills Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit): [https://medium.com/hello-thirteen23/just-the-facts-alexa-71a04b836d7f](https://medium.com/hello-thirteen23/just-the-facts-alexa-71a04b836d7f).

- Get a free **Microsoft Azure** voucher at our booth to use Microsoft Azure. Identify the speaker, turn spoken language into text, make sense ouf of text and understand the user's intent with [Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/). In fact, with that voucher you can access _all_ Azure Services for free!

- Call existing **Raiffeisen** APIs to get anonymized and [categorized financial user transactions](TODO) and integrate [financial user budget risk calculations](https://github.com/riticulus/RCH_Hackathon/blob/master/swagger%20hyporechner.json) into your application.
